ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm David

I'm a software engineer who loves building clean, efficient systems that solve real-world problems. I have professional experience shipping full-stack features, scaling backend services, and deploying serverless applications in production.

I'm an AWS Certified Developer â€“ Associate with hands-on experience deploying and managing serverless architectures using Node.js, Lambda, API Gateway, and more. On the frontend, I work comfortably with React, HTML/CSS, and modern UI frameworks.

In the backend world, I've worked extensively with Python (Django), Java, and SQL, including designing and optimizing relational databases and complex queries. I also have experience working in Dockerized environments and collaborating across cross-functional teams.

ðŸ§  CS Degree from Cal Poly Pomona, where I studied core topics like Data Structures & Algorithms, Software Engineering, and Database Systems.

Outside of work, I'm always exploring new tools, leveling up my skills, and contributing to side projects and experiments.
